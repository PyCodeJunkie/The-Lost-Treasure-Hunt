<h3>Story</h3>
You are a legendary adventurer on a quest to find the lost treasure of Captain Kidd, a notorious pirate who buried his wealth on a mysterious island centuries ago.

The journey to the island will not be easy. You will have to navigate treacherous waters, outwit dangerous pirates, and solve puzzles to uncover the secrets of Captain Kidd's treasure.

As you embark on your adventure, you'll receive guidance from an old sailor who has dedicated his life to finding the treasure. He will share with you maps, riddles, and stories that will help you on your journey.

But be warned, there are others who seek the treasure as well. Some will be friendly and offer their assistance, while others will do whatever it takes to get their hands on the treasure first.
